# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio website to GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

1. **Initialize Git** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Apple-inspired portfolio website"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Name it `my-portfolio` (or your preferred name)
   - Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - Don't initialize with README (since you already have files)

3. **Connect Local Repository to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-portfolio.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" tab

2. **Configure Pages**:
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Select "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - GitHub will build and deploy your site
   - This usually takes 1-2 minutes
   - You'll see a green checkmark when deployment is complete

### 3. Access Your Live Site

Your portfolio will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/my-portfolio
```

## 🔧 Customization Before Deployment

### Update Personal Information

Before deploying, make sure to update these key areas in `index.html`:

1. **Page Title and Meta Description**:
   ```html
   <title>Your Name - Electrical Engineering Portfolio</title>
   <meta name="description" content="Your description here">
   ```

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Update your name and title
   - Modify the subtitle to reflect your interests

4. **Projects Section**:
   - Replace sample projects with your actual work
   - Update project descriptions and technologies
   - Add real GitHub and demo links

5. **Skills Section**:
   - Update with your actual technical skills
   - Remove or add skills as needed

6. **Contact Section**:
   - Update email, location, and university information
   - Add your real social media links

7. **Footer**:

## 📁 File Structure After Deployment

Your repository should look like this:
```
my-portfolio/
├── index.html          # Main portfolio page
├── styles.css          # All styling
├── script.js           # Interactive functionality
├── sw.js              # Service worker for PWA
├── manifest.json      # PWA manifest
├── README.md          # Project documentation
├── DEPLOYMENT.md      # This deployment guide
└── .gitignore         # Git ignore rules
```

## 🔄 Updating Your Portfolio

To update your portfolio:

1. **Make Changes Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Edit your files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Pages Auto-Deploy**:
   - GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy
   - Changes are usually live within 1-2 minutes

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Site Not Loading**:
   - Check that your repository is public
   - Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
   - Wait a few minutes for initial deployment

2. **Styling Not Working**:
   - Ensure all CSS files are properly linked
   - Check for any syntax errors in CSS
   - Verify file paths are correct

3. **Images Not Displaying**:
   - Make sure image files are in the repository
   - Check image file paths in HTML
   - Use relative paths (e.g., `./images/photo.jpg`)

4. **Contact Form Not Working**:
   - The contact form is currently for demonstration
   - For a working form, you'll need a backend service
   - Consider using services like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or EmailJS

### Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. **Add CNAME File**:
   ```bash
   echo "yourdomain.com" > CNAME
   git add CNAME
   git commit -m "Add custom domain"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure DNS**:
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
   - Or add A records for GitHub Pages IPs

3. **Enable Custom Domain in GitHub**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Enter your custom domain
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

## 📱 Progressive Web App Features

Your portfolio includes PWA features:

- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
- **Installable**: Can be installed on mobile devices
- **Fast Loading**: Cached resources for quick access
- **App-like Experience**: Full-screen experience on mobile

## 🎯 SEO Optimization

Your portfolio is optimized for search engines:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper meta tags
- Fast loading times
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clean URLs

## 📊 Analytics (Optional)

To track visitors, you can add:

1. **Google Analytics**:
   - Add tracking code to `index.html`
   - Monitor visitor behavior and demographics

2. **GitHub Insights**:
   - View traffic statistics in repository Insights
   - Track popular content and referrers

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All content is static (HTML, CSS, JS)
- No server-side code or databases
- GitHub Pages provides HTTPS by default
- No personal data is stored or transmitted

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check GitHub Pages documentation
2. Review browser console for errors
3. Validate your HTML and CSS
4. Test locally before deploying
